It runs 3 neo motors connected to 3 CANSparkMaxes when enables in teleoperated mode and stops them when disabled

## How to run this:
*You need WPILib installed and must have a robot with 3 CANSparkMaxes connected to 3 Neo motors with the IDs 50, 51, and 20 to run this code

- Clone this repository and open it in the WPILib VSCode
